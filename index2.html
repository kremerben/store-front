…and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that-quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. Look, Larry… Have you ever heard of Vietnam? Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam-. Near the In-and-Out Burger.

My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites. I'm unemployed. No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Jesus, man, can you change the station? Say friend, ya got any more a that good sarsaparilla? Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well.

Do you have any kalhua? 1972 Pontiac LeBaron. That guy treats objects like women, man. Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together. Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug? It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous.
